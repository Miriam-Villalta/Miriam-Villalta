### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Frontend Developer with an interesing background in arts.
I'm very curious about different matters, which took me to work in various sections. I'm always searching to be a better version of myself as I like to help in everything I can.
I can't live without practising sports, specially Crossfit, which have given me strength, both physical and mental, and not to give up no matter how difficulties could come, specially when you believe in something.

My recent skills as a Frontend Developer, with some knowledge in Backend include:
- _HTML_
- _CSS and SASS_
- _JavaScript_
- _React_
- _Node.js_
- _Java_
- _SQL_

As mentioned before, I have previous skills in differents artistic matters as:
- Painting
- Esculture
- Graphic Design (Photoshop, Ilustrator, InDesing, Premier, Zbrush...)
- Make-up artist (zombies and FX is one of my best)
- Writing

All of this influence my work in a very creative way and I enjoy learning and doing new things every day.
