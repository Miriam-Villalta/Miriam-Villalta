### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an artist who recently became Frontend Developer by Adalab.
I'm very curious about different matters, which took me to work in various sections, always searching to be a better version of myself, I like to help in everything I can.
I can't live without practising sports, specially Crossfit, which have given me strength, both physical and mental, and not to give up no matter how difficulties could come, specially when you believe in something.

I would like to be part of a team who help me to reach that goal of improving every day and we can learn from each other.

My recent skills as a Frontend Developer include:
- _HTML_
- _CSS and SASS_
- _JavaScript_
- _React_
- _Gulp_

I'm currently developing new technical skills in:
- _Java_
- _SQL_

I have previous skills in differents matters as:
- Painting
- Esculture
- Graphic Design (Photoshop, Ilustrator, InDesing, Premier, AffertEffects, Zbrush...)
- Make-up artist (zombies and FX is one of my best)
- Writing

All of this influence my work in a very creative way and I enjoy learning and doing new things every day.
