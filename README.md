### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an artist who recently became Frontend Developer by Adalab.
I would like to be part of a team who help me to be a better version of myself and we can learn from each other.

I have previous skills in differents matters as:
- Painting
- Esculture
- Graphic Design
- Make-up artist (zombies and FX is one of my best)
- Writing

All of this influence my work in a very creative way and I enjoy learning and doing new things.
